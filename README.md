<p>As a beginner friendly, I have not added so much complex things as well as i have not broken the code into multiple components as you can do it by your own.</p>
<p>And, Further changes can be needed so it is all on you.</p>
<p>As in this the functional project is only your <span><b><u>App.jsx</u></b></span>, others are also functional but they all are on the way so stay tuned to have beginner friendly project.</p>

<h1>Thank You Guys,</h1>
